# Overwatch Issues

This repo exists to gather issues from clients of the Distributive Overwatch project. Please report any issues you have with the Overwatch service to [our issues page](https://github.com/Distributed-Compute-Labs/OverwatchIssues/issues). Please tell us as much as you can about the context of the issue and whatever happened prior to a bug or crash. This information is crucial to recreating the issue and developing a solution. We at the Distributive team appreciate your feedback and thank you for helping us make our product better!
