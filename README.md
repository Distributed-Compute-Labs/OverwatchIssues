# Overwatch Issues

This repo exists to gather issues from clients of the Distributive Overwatch project. You may report any issues you have with the Overwatch service to [our issues page](https://github.com/Distributed-Compute-Labs/OverwatchIssues/issues). Please tell us as much as you can about the context of the issue and whatever happened prior to a bug or crash, including any relavent code or log snippets. This information is crucial to recreating the issue and developing a solution. Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible.

We at the Distributive team appreciate your feedback and thank you for helping us make our product better!
